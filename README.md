# What's that? ðŸ¤”
This, my friend, is a ~pint~ project I've created in school.

My first real, fully functional game written in Deplhi 7.

I was quite a computer genius myself. Back then computers were not rare in my home country, but a 14 years old kids coding games was very rare, to say the least.

I wanted to create a game and tried a few times.

I took a demo-game from Delphi demos and changed colour, claimed it's mine! BS was called and I admitted that it was not really my game.

It took me a few years to improve and I did it!

I was inspired by the old-school games - [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) and [Galaxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxian).


# Some technical stuff
I wasn't good in programming, I didn't knew how to use resources â€“ so I've placed all the images on the hidden window and just reused them ðŸ˜‚

It was a super-primitive game and quite a trivial implementation.

All the images, background and spaceship models were created by me in Photoshop.

I was proud of myself and you know â€“ I'm still proud of that kid I was.

# 20 years old code and still working
I was impressed (not surprised though) how good backward compatible Windows is.

EXE binary compiled 19 years ago just worked on Win 11 and my old Delphi 7 installation gave me zero errors and I was able to set it up and then compile my little precious game.


## Footnote
Project name was "Star Wars" originally. Never heard about any copyrights back then. ðŸ˜…

I had to change it a bit, but just in case â€“ no copyrights infringement intended.
